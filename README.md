# Fantasy Premier League Optimizer üèÜ‚öΩ

Welcome to **B-Try** the **Fantasy Premier League Optimizer**! This Python project is designed to help you create the ultimate Fantasy Premier League (FPL) team by leveraging data from public APIs related to the English Premier League (EPL). Whether you're a seasoned FPL manager or a beginner, this tool will provide you with insights, statistics, and recommendations to dominate your league.

## üéØ **Goal**
The goal of this project is to:
1. **Explore and analyze EPL player data** from public APIs.
2. **Optimize your Fantasy Premier League team** by recommending the best players based on:
   - Player performance metrics (goals, assists, clean sheets, etc.).
   - Player value (cost vs. points).
   - Fixture difficulty (upcoming matches).
   - Injuries, suspensions, and other factors.
3. Provide **actionable insights** to help you make informed decisions for your FPL team.

## üìä **APIs Used**
This project may utilizes the following public APIs to gather data:

1. **[Official Fantasy Premier League API](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/)**
   - Provides real-time data on player stats, fixtures, and FPL-specific information (e.g., player prices, ownership percentages, and points).

2. **[Football-Data.org](https://www.football-data.org/)**
   - Offers comprehensive data on EPL fixtures, teams, and player statistics.
   - 10 calls per minutes

3. **[API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/)**
   - Provides live scores, fixtures, standings, and player performance data.
   - 100 call per day

4. **[Understat API](https://readthedocs.org/projects/understat/downloads/pdf/latest/)**
   - Not official library to consume [Understat](https://understat.com/) will explore it and see the potential

## üöÄ **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Fetch data from the APIs mentioned above.
   - Store the data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a database).

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data to extract relevant features.
   - Calculate metrics such as player form, fixture difficulty, and value for money.

3. **Optimization Algorithm**:
   - Use optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming, genetic algorithms) to select the best team within the FPL budget.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Provide a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple web app for users to interact with the tool.

5. **Output**:
   - Display the optimized team, player recommendations, and visualizations.
